      </p>
      <p>
        Our total liability to you for any claims arising from your use of our Services
        is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months before the claim arose,
        or $100, whichever is greater.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions don't allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SimpleHoops from any claims, losses, damages,

      </ul>

      <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>

      <h3>Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the state where
        SimpleHoops is registered, without regard to conflict of law principles.
      </p>

      <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a dispute with us, please contact us first at <a href="mailto:support@simplehoops.app">support@simplehoops.app</a>
        so we can try to resolve it informally.
      </p>

      <h3>Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        If we can't resolve a dispute informally, you agree that any claims will be resolved
        through binding arbitration, except where prohibited by law. You waive your right
        to a jury trial or to participate in a class action.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we'll
        notify you by email or through a notice in our app at least 30 days before the
        changes take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your continued use of our Services after changes take effect means you accept
        the new terms. If you don't agree to the changes, you should stop using our Services.
      </p>

      <h2>16. General Provisions</h2>

      <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>

        These terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement
        between you and SimpleHoops regarding our Services.
      </p>

      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining
        provisions will remain in full effect.
      </p>

      <h3>No Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Our failure to enforce any provision of these terms doesn't waive our right to
        enforce it later.
      </p>

      <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        You may not assign or transfer these terms or your account without our written
        consent. We may assign these terms without restriction.
