      <h2>Information About Minors</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that many users of basketball team apps are minors. Here's what parents and guardians should know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We only collect player names and jersey numbersâ€”no direct contact information for minors</li>
        <li>Parents/guardians must approve their child's participation through the team coach or administrator</li>
        <li>Player information is only used for team coordination (rosters, schedules, standings)</li>
        <li>Parents can request their child's information be removed by contacting the team admin or us directly</li>
        <li>We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) requirements</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take security seriously and implement industry-standard protections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
        <li>Data at rest is encrypted in secure databases</li>
        <li>Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text</li>
        <li>Access to personal information is restricted to essential personnel</li>
        <li>We regularly review and update our security practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive
        to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
        services. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal information within
        30 days, except where we're required to retain it for legal purposes.

        By using our services, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
